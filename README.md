# My Portfolio Website

This is a modern, responsive portfolio website built using **HTML** and **Tailwind CSS**, designed to showcase projects, provide contact information, and demonstrate front-end skills including dark mode, animation, and responsive layouts.

## What I Learned

This project helped me understand and apply the following key web development concepts:

- âœ… **Tailwind CSS (Utility-First Framework)**  
  Used for styling everything without writing traditional CSS â€” with utilities like `bg-gray-900`, `grid-cols-3`, `hover:bg-blue-700`, etc.

- âœ… **Dark Mode with Tailwind (`class` strategy)**  
  Toggled using JavaScript and Tailwindâ€™s built-in dark mode support with class-based switching.

- âœ… **Responsive Design**  
  Handled with Tailwindâ€™s responsive prefixes like `sm:`, `md:`, and `lg:` for layout adjustments on different screen sizes.

- âœ… **Animations**  
  Defined custom `fadeIn` animation using `@keyframes` in `tailwind.config.js` and applied with Tailwindâ€™s `animate-fadeIn` utility.

- âœ… **Grid and Flexbox Layouts**  
  Used both `flex` and `grid` utilities to build responsive sections like the projects gallery.

- âœ… **Semantic HTML**  
  Structured the site using meaningful HTML5 tags like `<header>`, `<section>`, `<footer>`, etc.

## Navbar Functionality

The **navigation bar** is built using Tailwind CSS and includes:

- A **logo/title**
- Links to scroll to each section: `Home`, `About`, `Projects`, and `Contact`
- A **dark mode toggle button** (`ðŸŒ™`) that switches themes when clicked

### How it works:

- The navbar is **fixed at the top** so it stays visible when scrolling.
- On small screens, the nav links are hidden (`md:flex` is used to show them only on medium and larger screens).
- The **dark mode toggle** uses JavaScript to toggle the `dark` class on the `<html>` element. This switches between light and dark styles instantly.
- Tailwindâ€™s transitions and hover states (`hover:text-blue-500`, `transition`) enhance interactivity.
